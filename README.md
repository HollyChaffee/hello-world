### hello-world

## First commit ever! (Of course because it is hello-world) :relaxed:
Hello!

Holly Chaffee checking in and writing random thoughts.

The ocean is vast, the sand immeasurable, the seashells beautiful, simple, and yet complex.
The sky is blue, it is gray, it is light, life, it is dark, consuming, freeing.
The forest is quiet, dense, beautiful, life-giving, dark, ominous-worth exploring.

Thankful to be alive!
